A NEW JAVA GAME FROM TEAM 3 STUDIOS
=======================================

=======================================
## BACKSTORY
=======================================

The year is 2076. Eternal winter has enveloped Earth following the devastating JODOK War.

In a far-flung corner of the planet, an epic battle rages on between the last living inhabitants of the city formerly known as Glasgow.

On one side: humanity's last hope, the Scottish cyborg DON-ALD C-60.

Opposing him: a horde of eldritch flying horrors, known only as The REGINAS.

Each day the forces of good and evil clash to gain control over The GOLDEN DONUGHT OF LLOYDS, an ancient artefact thought to contain the power to restore prosperity to the islands of Britain.

WHO WILL WIN? WHO WILL GAIN CONTROL OVER THE GOLDEN DOUGHNUT AND DECIDE THE FATE OF BRITAIN?


=======================================
## CHARACTERS
=======================================

DON-ALD C-60

Alias: Donald C.
Origin: City formerly known as Glasgow
Background:
Born before the JODOK War, Donald witnessed the downfall of humanity and the destruction of his home city of Glasgow.

Finding himself left amongst the ashes of civilisation, Donald harnessed the power of advanced cybernetics to artificially extend his lifespan, and give himself the lethal tools required to survive the post-JODOK War eternal winter.

Now armed with space age technology, Donald put his old life behind him and embraced his new life as DON-ALD C-60, cyborg protector of the Glaswegian Wastes!

One day his scanners picked up an energy signal beyond anything he'd ever encountered. Upon investigation, he discovered a mysterious glowing energy source with enough power to reignite the fires of humanity and restore prosperity to Britain. He had discovered the GOLDEN DOUGHNUT OF LLOYDS.

However, this new discovery had caught the attention of other dark forces that dwelt in the depths of the city formerly known as Glasgow...

=======================================

THE REGINAS

Origin: North Wales
Background:
Hailing from the dark wastes of North Wales, The Reginas are a corrupted race of airborne scavengers.

Their pre-war ancestors had soared the skies, menacing humanity by periodically swooping to steal valuable resources.

With humanity out of the picture, The Reginas were free to conquer the islands of Britain entirely. Over time, they evolved to be bigger, more grotesque and even more deadly than ever before.

One day, in the northern expanses of their vast apocalyptic kingdom, Regina footsoldiers felt the call of a new powerful artefact.

They swooped in once again to investigate, only to find a new foe also moving in to strike: the cyborg known as DON-ALD C-60.

The Reginas looked at each other and squawked in unison: "He will not stand in our way. The DON-ALD must be destroyed!" 

=======================================

THE GOLDEN DOUGHNUT OF LLOYDS

Origin: ???
Background:
A mysterious glowing doughnut, holding an immense power within its ringed form.

Many years ago, while searching the ruins of the city formerly known as Glasgow, DON-ALD C-60 came across a dossier containing blueprints for a top secret power source.

Funded by Lloyds Bank, the project promised to deliver the power of the sun in a compact doughnut-sized object.

DON-ALD had dismissed the dossier as pre-war nonsense. However, since the Golden Doughnut had mysteriously arrived in his city's streets, he couldn't help but wonder...


=======================================
## RULES
=======================================

Joining the battle is simple... but winning won't be easy!

STEP 1:

Launch the game by entering the 'javac .\PlayGame.java' and 'java PlayGame' commands in your terminal._

STEP 2:

It's time to create your BATTLEFIELD!

The number you enter will determine the size of the BATTLEFIELD.

E.g. entering '5' will create a 5x5 grid style BATTLEFIELD.

STEP 3:

DON-ALD C-60's scanners are hard at work, and you will be told how close you are to the GOLDEN DOUGHNUT!

You can now make your move on the BATTLEFIELD using the following commands:

u - move up
d - move down
l - move left
r - move right

STEP 4:

TREAD CAREFULLY!

Danger lurks around every corner. The sinister REGINAS lurk on the BATTLEFIELD, but they won't make their presence known.

If you bump into a REGINA, all will be lost, and humanity's last hope will be extinguished!

STEP 5:

Carefully navigate the BATTLEFIELD using the movement commands to reach the GOLDEN DONUGHT.

Can you beat the REGINAS and help restore prosperity to the island of Britain?

JOIN THE BATTLE NOW AND FIND OUT!
